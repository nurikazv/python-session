# for i in range(20):
#     print(i)
    
# for i in range(-10, 11):
#     print(i)
    
    
# for i in range(-10, 11, 2):
#     print(i)
    
    
# print(range(10))

# num = int(input("Your number: "))

# for i in range(num + 1):
#     print(f"Number {i}")



# num = int(input("Your number: "))

# for i in range(num + 1):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)
